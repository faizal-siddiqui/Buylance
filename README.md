  ],
  "reviews": [],
  "id": 21
  }
  ```

  - Profile api (For all the products)

  ```
    {
       id: 2,
       name: "Amaan Sid",
       email: "amaansidp@gmail.com",
       mobile: 7867789867,
       gender: "Male",
       birthDate: "23-09-2002",
       location: "Delhi",
       cardDetails: "89878676565441",
       password: "Aman!234",
       cart: [
          .....all the products that we have added to the cart similar to the products api
      ],
      orderedProducts: [
         ......all the products that we have moved after payment
      ]
    }

  ```

  - cart key and orderedProducts key
    - not directly but we have to patch the data inside cart by using logics
